# 🧠 Reduxverse: RTK Revision Hub

Welcome to **Reduxverse** — a compact galaxy of my learnings from Huxn Webdev Course and fundamentals around **Redux**, **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**, and **RTK Query**. This repository serves as a practical revision and personal documentation space where I dive into state management, slices, async thunks, and efficient data fetching using RTK Query.

## 🚀 What is Reduxverse?

**Reduxverse** is not just a revision project — it's a carefully structured playground where I experiment with:

- 🔁 **Redux Fundamentals**  
- 🛠️ **Redux Toolkit Setup & Configuration**
- 🌐 **RTK Query for Data Fetching**
- 🎯 **Store Structure and Normalized State**

Whether you're revising like me or just exploring Redux for the first time, this repo will help you understand the key concepts with clean examples.
